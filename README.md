# CatsVsDogs image binary classification 
Using Python, I have trained a Convolutional Neural Network on a set of training data. 

# Key Features of the Convolutional Neural Network
1. Multiple layers of max-pooling, convolution 
2. Dropout function to reduce overfitting 
3. Adam Optimizer to minimize loss
